## Weird Recipes to Try

### 1. Cheese, yogurt and applesauce whipped cream

#### Ingredients

1. Cheese (any kind of cheese; it doesn't matter) 
2. Applesauce (it can be any kind: mango, blueberry, plain apple ... it really does not ruin the dish if you think you put the wrong applesauce in)
3. Yogurt (also can be any kind of yogurt)
4. Whipped cream
5. Food coloring

You'll also need a bowl and a spoon.

#### Directions

1. Put 6 slices of cheese on the cuttingboard and spread the yogurt on top. 
2. Put the cheese and yogurt in a medium sized bowl. 
3. Take a spoon and mash the cheese. 
4. Then pour the applesauce on top. Mix well. 
5. Lastly, put in some whipped cream. You can add any kind of food coloring for color,too! 

If you want, you can add sprinkles and candy, and things you might put on a cake. You also can put it on a cake, if you want to, as frosting for a cake (of course, if you're having cheesecake it will blend in and taste like cheese)!
